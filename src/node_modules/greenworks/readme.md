# Greenworks

Greenworks is a MIT-licensed node.js addon allowing you to integrate your HTML5
app or game with [Steamworks](http://www.steampowered.com/steamworks/) by
exposing a number of Steamworks APIs to JavaScript.

Greenworks is developed by Greenheart Games, originally to enable Steam
integration in [Game Dev Tycoon](http://www.greenheartgames.com/app/game-dev-tycoon/),
and has been open-sourced and [used in other projects](https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks/wiki/Apps-games-using-greenworks).
The project is funded by Greenheart Games and other
[donors](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/27218#donors).

support different node versions.
